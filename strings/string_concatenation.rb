# -------------String concatenation-----------
# String concatenation in Ruby refers to the process of combining two or more strings
# into a single string. This is typically achieved using the + operator or the << operator. 
# When you concatenate strings, you essentially append one string to the end of another, 
# creating a longer string that contains the combined contents of the original strings.

first_name = "Amen" # using double quotes
last_name = 'Musingarimi' # using double quotes
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
puts full_name
